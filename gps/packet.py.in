"""Recognize GPS packets using the lexer from libgpsd and ctypes.

The new() function returns a new packet-lexer instance.  Lexer instances
have two methods:
    get() takes a file handle argument and returns a tuple consisting of
the integer packet type and string packet value.  At the end of the stream
it returns (-1, "").
    reset() resets the packet-lexer to its initial state.
    The module also has a register_report() function that accepts a callback
for debug message reporting.  The callback will get two arguments: the error
level of the message; and the message itself.
