== DESCRIPTION

*gpsd* is a daemon for managing GPS receivers, GNSS receivers, AIS
receivers, and more.  Over time it has agglomerated a number of
diverse clients that communicate with *gpsd* for various tasks.

=== CLIENTS

Each of the *gpsd* clients connects to a *gpsd* daemon to use the
data in various ways.  See the sections ARGUMENTS and OPTIONS for
more information on the clients.

*cgps*:: curses terminal client for gpsd
*gegps*:: Google Earth client for gpsd
*gps*:: Overview of gpsd clients and helpers
*gpscsv*:: dump the JSON output from gpsd as CSV
*gpsdecode*:: decode GPS, RTCM or AIS streams into a readable format
*gpsmon*:: real-time GPS packet monitor and control utility
*gpspipe*:: tool to connect to gpsd and retrieve sentences
*gpsplot*:: tool to dynamically dump plot data from gpsd
*gpsprof*:: profile a GPS and gpsd, plotting latency information
*gpsrinex*:: Read data from gpsd convert to RINEX3 and save to a file.
*gpssubframe*:: tool to dump subframe sentences from gpsd
*gpxlogger*:: Tool to connect to gpsd and generate a GPX file
*lcdgps*:: LCD client for gpsd
*xgps*:: X client for gpsd
*xgpsspeed*:: X speedometer for gpsd

=== HELPERS

The *gpsd* helpers can be used for administration of *gpsd* systems.

*gps2udp*::  feed the take from gpsd to one or more aggregation sites
*gpscat*::  dump the output from a GPS
*gpsctl*::  control the modes of a GNSS receiver
*gpsdctl*::  tool for sending commands to gpsd over its control socket
*gpsdebuginfo*:: Generate a gpsd debug dump of your host.
*gpsfake*::  test harness for gpsd, simulating a GNSS receiver
*gpsinit*::  initialize CAN kernel modules for GPSD
*ntploggps*::  log gpsd data
*ntpshmmon*::  capture samples from gpsd or other ntpd refclock sources

=== LIBRARIES

Programmers can find additional information on the *gpsd* here:

*gpsd_json*::  gpsd request/response protocol
*libgps*::  C service library for communicating with the GPS daemon
*libgpsmm*::  C++ and QT class wrappers for the GPS daemon
*libQgpsmm*::  C++ and QT class wrappers for the GPS daemon

== OPTIONS

The *gpsd* clients share a few common options:

*-?*, *-h*, *--help*::
  Print a summary of options and then exit.
*-V*, *--version*::
  Print the package version and exit.

== ARGUMENTS

By default, clients collect data from the local *gpsd* daemon running
on localhost, using the default GPSD port 2947. The optional argument
to any client may override this behavior:

*[server[:port[:device]]]*

*server*:: The optional host name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address of
the *gpsd* daemon to connect to. If the server specification contains
square brackets, the part inside them is taken as an IPv6 address and
port/device suffixes are only parsed after the trailing bracket. The
default is localhost.

*port*:: The optional TCP port of the daemon to connect to. The default
is 2947.

*device*:: The optional device name to be watched.

Some possible cases look like this:

example.com;;
  Connect to the default port 2497 on example.com, trying both IPv4 and IPv6.
example.com:2317;;
  Look at port 2317 on example.com, trying both IPv4 and IPv6.
localhost::/dev/ttyS1;;
  Look at the default port, 2947, of localhost, trying both IPv4 and IPv6 and
  watching output from serial device 1.
71.162.241.5:2317:/dev/ttyS3;;
  Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv4 address, collecting data from
  attached serial device 3.
[FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:2317:/dev/ttyS5;;
  Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv6 address, collecting data from
  attached serial device 5.

== ENVIRONMENT

Most of the *gpsd* clients check for the environment variables
*GPSD_UNITS*, *LC_MEASUREMENT*, and *LANG*.  Maybe more.

*GPSD_UNITS* is checked if no unit system is specified on the command
line. It may be set to 'i'. 'imperial', 'm', 'metric', or 'n',
'nautical'.

*LC_MEASUREMENT* and then *LANG* are checked if no unit system has been
specified on the command line, or in *GPSD_UNITS*. If the value is 'C',
'POSIX', or begins with 'en_US' the unit system is set to imperial. The
default if no system has been selected is metric.

== RETURN VALUES

The *gpsd* clients return simple success or failure codes:

*0*:: on success.
*1*:: on failure
