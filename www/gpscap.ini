#
# To inherit capabilities from a specified section, name the section in

# When an "engine" lsting is pulled in with "engine =" the only key used is
# "techdoc".

# Certain escapes in capability strings are translated:
#
# %b    - baud rate as ASCII numeral
#
# A string beginning with 0x is interpreted as a sequence of paired hex bytes,
# leading 0x not included.
#
# Comment lines led with "#%" are vendor section marks to be used when
# generating an HTML table from this file.  Each should consist of a vendor
# name.
#
# Further notes:
# * In the packaging field, a "GPS mouse" is a standalone sensor in a
#   display-less case designed be used as an outbard peripheral.  An
#   "OEM module" is an un-cased circuit board with edge connectors; a
#   "chipset" is what it sounds like.
#   A "handset" is a standalone GPS with a display and human-usable
#   controls. A "handsfree" is a hands-free unit with display designed for
#   mounting on a car windshield or boat dash.
#   A "box" is a standalone case with connectors for antenna and serial
#   interfaces. Typicallly part of an evaluation kit.
# * In the rating field:
#    "excellent" - gpsd recognizes the GPS rapidly and reliably,
#                 reports are complete and correct.
#    "good" -- gpsd has minor problems or lag recognizing the device,
#             but reports are complete and correct.
#    "fair" -- Reports have minor dropouts or problems, including occasional
#             transient nonsense values.
#    "poor" -- Reports frequently have values that are wrong or nonsense.
#    "broken" -- gpsd frequently fails to recognize the device at all.

notes = SiRF-IV variant produced for the Chinese market; it handles the
      Beidou and GLONASS constellations as well as US GPS.  The main
      variant is described by the Chinese standard "Technical
      Specification of Communication Protocol for BDS Compatible
      Positioning Module" (TSCPB) and uses the talker ID BD.  This
      standard is not available in English translation. There is a
      variant with closer NMEA 4.00 conformance that uses the talker
      ID GB.

      is the lower power needs.  Looks like they made that happen at

      has the SiRF-IV tendency to freeze when switched from binary

      can be done with the rgm3800py utility by Karsten Petersen. The author of
      said tool has been very helpful to me by describing how to do that on
      the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rgm3800py/wiki/GPSd">
      projectpage</a>. Basically, one needs to run "rgm3800.py -d
      /dev/ttyUSB0 gmouse on" before starting gpsd.

      data. Pilotplugs are RS422, 38400 8N1. This data is obtained via
      a Moxa UPort 1130 using Minicom.  GPSD does not work well with
      the UPort 1130, but the data is recognised (but not all NMEA
      sentences). This is from a simulator but with real equipment.
